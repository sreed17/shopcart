<p align="center">Effortlessly integrate a fully customizable shopping cart into your React applications with React Shopping Cartâ€”type-safe, flexible, and ready to streamline your e-commerce development workflow!</p>

The `@sreed17/shoppingcart` library empowers developers to effortlessly integrate a shopping cart functionality into their React applications with utmost flexibility and type safety. You can **_generate a fully functional shopping cart context, provider, and hook tailored to your product types_**.

## Features

### 1. Universal Cart Generation

Easily create a shopping cart for any product type by providing a generic type parameter. The library dynamically generates a shopping cart context, provider, and hook specific to your product type, ensuring seamless integration and type safety.

### 2. Intuitive Context Usage

Access the shopping cart state anywhere in your React application using the created use hook. Retrieve essential cart information, such as item count and subtotal, with ease, enabling smooth rendering of shopping cart components.

### 3. Type-Safe Modifications

Interact with the shopping cart state in a type-safe manner. Utilize the provided class instance as the context, allowing for straightforward and type-checked modifications to the cart, ensuring data integrity and reliable application behavior.

## Installation

You can install shoppingcart using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @sreed17/shoppingcart
# or
yarn add @sreed17/shoppingcart
```

## Usage

To integrate `shoppingcart` into your React application, follow these steps:

### 1. Installation

First, install the `shoppingcart` package via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @sreed17/shoppingcart
```

or

```bash
yarn add @sreed17/shoppingcart
```

### 2. Usage

#### 1. Create the ShoppingCartProvider context provider and useShoppingCart hook from your product type.

```ts
/**
 * @file MyShoppingCart.tsx
 * @description Shopping cart tailored for your product type
 */

// import shoppingCart function (default) from shoppingcart
import shoppingCart from "@sreed17/shoppingcart";

// Define your product type
interface MyProductType {
	// definition of your product type
}

// Generate the provider and hook for your product type
export const { ShoppingCartProvider, useShoppingCart } =
	shoppingCart<MyProductType>();

// Your are now ready to use the the shopping cart tailored for your product type!
```

#### 2. Using the ShoppingCartProvider.

Wrap ShoppingCartProvider around components that need t access the cart.

```ts
import {ShoppingCartProvider} from "./MyShoppingCart"
// rest of the code...
return<>
<ShoppingCartProvider>
 // child-components
</ShoppingCartProvider>
```

You can add `onCheckout` attribute to set a handler for when checkout method is triggered from the children.

#### 3. Using the useShoppingCart hook.

It provides can instance of ShoppingCart class named `cart` and an `is_loading` flag.
Read the [documentation](https://github.com/sreed17/shoppingcart/blob/master/docs/classes/ShoppingCart.default.md) to see all the available methods available in the cart;

```ts
/**
 * @file Child-component.tsx
 * @description A child component that uses the shopping cart context.
 */

// ...other imports
import {useShoppingCart} from "./MyShoppingCart";

// other definitions

const ChildComponent:FC<PropType> = ({/* Props */})=>{

/**
 * cart: instance of the shopping cart class, can take null value hence needs null check.
 * is_loading: whether the context is loaded on component mount
 */
const {cart, is_loading} = useShoppingCart();

// null check cart and use the is_loading flag to stabilize rendering

return <div>
<div>Item count: {cart.item_count}<div>

{/** Render the cart items */}
<ul>
{
cart.map((cartItem)=>{
  const {id, aggregate_price, quantity} = cartItem;
  return <li key={id}>
 <span>{id}</span>
 <span>{aggregate_price}</span>
 <span>{quantity}</span>
  </li>
})
}
</ul>

</div>
}
```

#### ShoppingCartProvider

This provider manages the state of the shopping cart and provides access to it throughout the application.

```jsx
import { ShoppingCartProvider, useShoppingCart } from "./ShoppingCart";

// Use the provider in your application
function App() {
	return (
		<ShoppingCartProvider onCheckout={handleCheckout} persist={persistConfig}>
			{/* Your application components */}
		</ShoppingCartProvider>
	);
}
```

By default persistance is `disabled` and the storage is set to an instance of `LocalStoragePersistence` which uses localstorage api to persist data. You can add your own peristance `storage` by implementing `IStorage` interface.
